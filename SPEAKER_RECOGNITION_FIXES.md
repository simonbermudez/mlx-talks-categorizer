# Speaker Recognition Fixes - Picovoice Eagle Integration

## Issues Found in Log Analysis

### 1. ‚ùå Zero Scores from Eagle Recognizer (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** All speaker identification attempts returned 0.000 scores
```
Best match Hogen below threshold (score: 0.000, threshold: 0.5)
```

**Root Cause:** Potential audio format incompatibility or frame processing issue

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added audio normalization before int16 conversion to prevent clipping
- ‚úÖ Added detailed debug logging to track frame processing
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling with full stack traces
- ‚úÖ Added validation for empty audio files

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete Speaker Enrollment
**Problem:** Several speakers failed to reach 100% enrollment:
- Samantha: 46.5% (need 53.5% more)
- Jorge: 18.0% (need 82.0% more)
- Jason: 29.5% (need 70.5% more)
- Melissa: 35.0% (need 65.0% more)

**Solution:** Provide longer or additional audio samples for these speakers

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced enrollment to check completion percentage
- ‚úÖ Added warnings for incomplete enrollments with specific percentages needed
- ‚úÖ Profiler now stops early if 100% enrollment reached
- ‚úÖ Speakers with <100% enrollment are excluded from recognizer

### 3. ‚ùå Picovoice Error Codes
**Problem:** Some audio files caused enrollment/recognition errors:
```
Error codes: 000001D6 (470 decimal) and 00000136 (310 decimal)
```

Affected speakers: Jogen, Kisei, Fuho, Jomon
Affected recognition: Kosho.mp3, Test.mp4

**Possible Causes:**
- Incompatible audio codec
- Corrupted audio file
- Invalid sample rate
- Unsupported audio format

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added try-catch blocks around individual enrollments
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error logging with stack traces
- ‚úÖ Audio files with errors are now skipped gracefully

## Code Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Audio Reading (`_read_audio_file`)
```python
# Before: Basic conversion to int16
audio_int16 = (audio * 32767).astype(np.int16)

# After: Normalized and validated
max_val = np.max(np.abs(audio))
if max_val > 0:
    audio = audio / max_val
audio_int16 = (audio * 32767).astype(np.int16)
```

### 2. Improved Enrollment (`_enroll_speaker`)
- Tracks enrollment percentage across all files
- Stops when 100% reached
- Validates completion before export
- Provides specific feedback on missing audio

### 3. Debug Logging (`identify_speaker`)
- Logs audio length and frame counts
- Shows first 3 frame scores
- Displays all speaker scores
- Full traceback on errors

### 4. Configurable Logging
- Added `log_level` to config.json
- Set to DEBUG for detailed troubleshooting
- Can be changed to INFO for production

## Next Steps to Fix Recognition

### Step 1: Run Speaker Check
```bash
python check_speakers.py
```

This will show you:
- Total audio duration per speaker
- Which speakers need more audio
- Specific recommendations

### Step 2: Add More Audio Samples

For speakers with insufficient enrollment:
1. Record or find more audio of each speaker (30-60 seconds)
2. Name files: `SpeakerName_1.mp3`, `SpeakerName_2.mp3`, etc.
3. Place in `organized_talks/speakers/`

### Step 3: Fix Problematic Audio Files

For speakers with enrollment errors (Jogen, Kisei, Fuho, Jomon):
1. Check audio file integrity
2. Re-encode to standard format:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i original.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -acodec pcm_s16le fixed.wav
   ```
3. Replace the original files

### Step 4: Test with Debug Logging

Run with debug logging enabled:
```bash
python main.py --full-scan
```

Check `audio_manager.log` for:
- Enrollment percentages reaching 100%
- Non-zero frame scores during recognition
- Any remaining error codes

### Step 5: Verify Recognition

Look for these in the logs:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Speaker identified: Hogen (score: 0.847)"
‚ùå Bad:  "Best match Hogen below threshold (score: 0.000, threshold: 0.5)"
```

## Expected Log Output After Fixes

### Successful Enrollment:
```
INFO - Enrolling speaker: Hogen with 1 sample(s)
DEBUG - Eagle profiler sample rate: 16000Hz
DEBUG - Loaded audio: 480000 samples at 16000Hz
INFO - Hogen.mp3: 100.0% - EagleProfilerEnrollFeedback.AUDIO_OK
INFO - Successfully enrolled speaker: Hogen with 100.0% completion
```

### Successful Recognition:
```
DEBUG - Audio length: 86400 samples, Frame length: 512, Num frames: 168
DEBUG - Frame 0 scores: [0.156, 0.823, 0.045, 0.021, 0.089]
DEBUG - Frame 1 scores: [0.142, 0.847, 0.038, 0.019, 0.076]
DEBUG - Average scores for all speakers: {'Hogen': 0.145, 'Gensho': 0.834, ...}
INFO - Speaker identified: Gensho (score: 0.834)
```

## Configuration Changes

Added to `config.json`:
```json
{
  "log_level": "DEBUG",  // Change to INFO after debugging
  "speaker_similarity_threshold": 0.5  // Adjusted for Eagle (was 0.85)
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If you still see 0.000 scores:
1. Check debug logs for frame scores
2. Verify Eagle profiler sample rate matches recognizer
3. Test with a known enrolled speaker's audio
4. Contact Picovoice support with error codes

### If enrollment fails with error codes:
1. Try re-encoding the audio file to WAV format
2. Ensure sample rate is 16kHz (Eagle's native rate)
3. Check for file corruption
4. Verify audio file is not DRM protected

### If enrollment gets stuck below 100%:
1. Add more audio samples
2. Ensure audio has clear speech (not music/silence)
3. Check for background noise
4. Try different recordings of the same speaker

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixes Applied:**
- Enhanced audio normalization
- Improved error handling
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Better enrollment validation
- Configurable log levels

üìã **Action Required:**
1. Add more audio for: Samantha, Jorge, Jason, Melissa
2. Fix/replace audio for: Jogen, Kisei, Fuho, Jomon
3. Run with DEBUG logging to diagnose zero scores
4. Verify enrollment reaches 100% for all speakers

üîç **Investigation Needed:**
- Why Eagle returns 0.000 scores (check debug logs after re-run)
- Root cause of Picovoice error codes 000001D6 and 00000136
